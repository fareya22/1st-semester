Sometimes it's better to be alone.Basically we are always alone .We born alone we'll die alone. But in the mean time 
we should do some extra-ordinary work so that people will remember us even after our death and we should do some
works for the life after death too . but im not doing anything . This bad habit of depending on others is like a curse
for me.When someone show me some sympathy i become depended on him/her like amit or trina.Which is very disappointing .
Now i can't do anything without my friends.I feel so bad and lonely now.I always need someone beside me.but right now
i have none.no friends no guardian.I miss my mom very much.I feel like crying...
